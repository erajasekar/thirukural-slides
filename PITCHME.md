## Are computers smart?
@title[Computers are stupid]

<p class="fragment">Computers are really **stupid**. But it is very *fast*. </p>
<p class="fragment">Humans are **smart**, but *slow*. </p>
<p class="fragment">Computers can **tirelessly** do repetitive tasks whereas humans will get *exhausted* . </p>

@title[Binary Introduction]

Infact, the hardware inside the computer doesn't know anything other than 0’s and 1’s.

---
@title[Everything is stored as binary]

All the videos, music and textual information you see in computers are stored as just **0’s** and **1’s.**

## Why the digital world has only 0 & 1?
@title[Why digital world has only 0 and 1?]

<p class="fragment">All the hardware is made from wonderful semiconductor material ***silicon***. </p>
<p class="fragment"> It can easily change state between stop conducting ( **0** ) and start conducting ( **1** ) electricity through them. </p>
<p class="fragment">Silicon is used to make a tiny device called ***transistor*** which stores one bit of 0 or 1 - refered as ***binary***. </p>

Note: Discuss about conductors and insulators.

---

## What's inside Computers?

> Computers are made of billions of tiny ***transistors*** which can be programmed to flip states between 0 and 1 using electrical signals.

---
@title[Human brain and Computers]

Just like billions of neurons fire in our Human brain based on visual, auditory or sensory signal.

## Why computers is a genius invention? 

- It will be super expensive, if we had to build a new computer for every different thing we want to do. 

- Instead, we invented a general purpose computer containing a assembly of transistors that can do different things, depending on which transistors are swiched on and off.  

Note: For eg. We don't need a separate device to play each game. We can play several games in a single computer or a phone.

@title[What are Algorithms?]

We need to provide a sequence of instructions telling a computer to what to do which is called as ***Algorithms***.

---

### Algorithm example

Algorithm to tell if temperature is Below or Above the Freezing Point

<img src="assets/image/algorithm-example.png" alt="Algorithm to tell temperature is freezing point" width="400px" height="400px">

---

### How transistors execute Algorithms?

Transistors are combined to create ***logic gates*** that can perform logical operations like ***AND***, ***OR***, ***NOT***

Every algorithm, no matter how complex, can be reduced to just these three operations: AND, OR, and NOT.

---

### Algorithm logic gates example

if a fever can be caused by influenza or malaria, and you should take Tylenol for a fever and a headache

<img src="assets/image/algorithm-logic.png" alt="Algorithm that uses transistor logical operations" width="350px" height="350px">

### Algorithms can solve complex problems

Algorithms can be combined together to solve complex problems.

Just like simple mathematical operations are combined to produce complex mathematical formulas.

Algorithms fly the airplanes, forecast weather, play games, tell us driving directions and so on.
